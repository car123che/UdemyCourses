## What is JUnit?
It is a framework for unit testing, for every piece of code you develop you write test that verifies the proper 
function of the code. 
With JUnit you can separate your test from your code, there is no need for main() methods, also JUnit has a growing
library of tests. 
## Test
When you make a test, if the code passes the test, you will have a green bar and if it fails you will have a red
bar and a message depending of the test you made.
